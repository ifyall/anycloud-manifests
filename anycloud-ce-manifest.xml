    <description><![CDATA[
    This code example demonstrates implementing an MQTT client using the MQTT client library for the family of Cypress connectivity devices. This library uses the AWS IoT Device SDK that includes an MQTT 3.1.1 client. 
    <br><br><b>License Disclaimer:</b><br><br>
    This code example makes use of the lwIP open-source TCP/IP stack and the Mbed TLS open-source TLS/SSL library which has cryptographic capabilities. Creating a project from this template will cause lwIP and Mbed TLS to be downloaded on your computer. It is your responsibility to understand and accept the lwIP &amp; Mbed TLS licenses and regional use restrictions (including abiding by all applicable export control laws).
